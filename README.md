Here is a small and concise README for your Task 2 GitHub repository:

Churn Prediction System (FUTURE_ML_02)
This project implemented a Machine Learning model to predict customer attrition using the Telco Customer Churn dataset. The goal was to identify high-risk customers for targeted retention efforts.

Key Results
Model: XGBoost Classifier was selected for its robust performance.

Performance: Achieved an excellent ROC-AUC of 0.89.

Top Insight: Contract Type (specifically, month-to-month) was identified as the most critical driver of churn probability.

Deliverables
Churn_Report.pdf: Full analysis, model comparison, and business recommendations.

churn_xgb_model.pkl: The final, best-performing predictive model.

Task_2_Churn_prediction_system.ipynb: Project code.
